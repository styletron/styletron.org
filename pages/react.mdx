## Motivation

**React components are independent and reusable pieces of UI**. They accept props and return a description of what should appear on the screen - typically, in a form of HTML markup. For long time, the styles were left outside of React components and handled by different means. You probably wrote or saw this code before:

```jsx live
class MyApp extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    this.state = {
      isActive: false
    };
  }
  render() {
    const { isActive } = this.state;
    return (
      <button
        className={`btn ${isActive ? "btn-active" : ""}`}
        onClick={() => {
          this.setState(prev => ({ isActive: !prev.isActive }));
        }}
      >
        It is {isActive ? "on" : "off"}!
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

It is pretty clear that `MyApp` renders a button that can be in active or inactive state. **What's not clear is the button's appearance**. It applies `.btn` and `.btn-active` CSS classes but we don't know where those classes are defined, what rules they contain and what the overall import/build process is. Suddenly, our encapsulated piece of UI heavily relies on a code that lives outside of it. **Our component lost its independence and isolation**. We can't just simply copy&paste it into a different project and expect it to work. **It's not portable anymore**.

To make it even more awkward, **the component state should directly control the button's appearance or what CSS rules are applied**. _When the button is active, its background should be blue_. We have to toggle class names and glue together the `className` prop. It gets even less readable if there are multiple states.

```jsx
className={`btn ${isActive ? "btn-active" : ""}`}
```

We call this concept **dynamic styling**. It happens when we need to map `props` and `state` directly into the resulting styles. This is very hard with classic CSS since you cannot easily pass variables from JavaScript to CSS.

_Side note: CSS modules partly addresses some of these concerns but still requires an extra tooling and their portability story is generally weak._

Things are looking grim so far. But what if I told you that **we can solve all those issues by using inline styles**?

```jsx live
class MyApp extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    this.state = {
      isActive: false
    };
  }
  render() {
    const { isActive } = this.state;
    return (
      <button
        style={{
          padding: "0.5em 1em",
          color: isActive ? "#fff" : "#000",
          background: isActive ? "#276ef1" : "none",
          fontSize: "1em",
          borderRadius: "4px",
          border: "1px solid #aaa"
        }}
        onClick={() => {
          this.setState(prev => ({ isActive: !prev.isActive }));
        }}
      >
        It is {isActive ? "on" : "off"}!
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

All styles are now encapsulated in the component. We can clearly see what rules are being used. We don't have to worry about a special build process. **Oh, and no `className` joggling either - we don't even have classNames now!** But, inline styles have some very serious limitations: For example, you can't use pseudo selectors like `:hover` or media queries.

If there was only a way how to get the best of both worlds. 🤔

… \*drum roll\* … introducing

## Styled Components

**Styletron provides APIs and developer experience similar to inline styles but without any drawbacks**. Let's do the button example again but this time with Styletron:

```jsx live
import { styled } from "styletron-react";

class MyApp extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    this.state = {
      isActive: false
    };
  }
  render() {
    const Button = styled("button", props => ({
      padding: "0.5em 1em",
      color: props.$isActive ? "#fff" : "#000",
      background: props.$isActive ? "#276ef1" : "none",
      fontSize: "1em",
      borderRadius: "4px",
      border: "1px solid #aaa",
      ":hover": {
        background: props.$isActive ? "green" : "yellow"
      }
    }));
    const { isActive } = this.state;
    return (
      <Button
        $isActive={isActive}
        onClick={() => {
          this.setState(prev => ({ isActive: !prev.isActive }));
        }}
      >
        It is {isActive ? "on" : "off"}!
      </Button>
    );
  }
}
```

It looks somewhat similar to the inline style example. The styles are still defined inside of the component; however, this time we are doing an extra step - **we are creating a styled component with the `styled` function**.

The `styled` function expects two arguments:

- **Element type** - What underlying DOM element should be used. In our case, we chose `button`.
- **Style function / object** - To describe the styles. It can be a plain styled object or a function that returns a styled object. The function gets `props`. That's useful if your styles need to be dynamic (derived from `props`).

For styling properties, we use camelCase and there are some other subtle differences described in [Concepts](/concept). We can also now use pseudo classes as `:hover`. **The inline styles limitations don't apply anymore!**

Once the styled component is created, we can render it as any other React component. **We don't need to specify `style` or `className` prop**. The styled component already does that for us on the background - Styletron creates a bunch of CSS classes and "glues" them to the `<button />` element. Check the [Home page example](/#example) for more details.

One thing that might seem a bit off is the `$isActive` prop. Why do we use `$` when we could simply call it `isActive` instead?

## Props Filtering

Note that we are passing two props into our styled `Button` component

```jsx
<Button $isActive={/*…*/} onClick={/*…*/}>…</Button>
```

and they have very different purposes:

- `$isActive` is used to create the style object
- `onClick` is an event handler that needs to be passed to the underlying `button` element, we don't use it for styling purposes at all

The problem is **Styletron doesn't see the difference.** It doesn't know what props should or shouldn't be passed all the way down to the underlying element. **What happens when all props are blindly passed to the DOM element?**

> Warning: React does not recognize the `$isActive` prop on a DOM element. If you intentionally want it to appear in the DOM as a custom attribute, spell it as lowercase `$isactive` instead. If you accidentally passed it from a parent component, remove it from the DOM element.

So you need to help Styletron a bit. **All props starting with `$` are filtered out and not passed to the underlying element**. That's the only and whole purpose of `$`.

Styletron could whitelist all DOM attributes and filter out other props but that's [considered as an anti-pattern](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/822526388557250560?lang=en). Mostly, because it would make the bundle bigger and it's bad for performance.

The warning message above was manufactured since `$isActive` is filtered out by Styletron. However, if you renamed it to `isActive` you would see it!

## `$as` prop

`$as` has a special meaning. **It allows you to swap the underlying element**:

```jsx live
() => {
  const Text = styled("p", { color: "red" });
  return (
    <>
      <Text>Rendered as a paragraph</Text>
      <Text $as="button">Rendered as a button</Text>
    </>
  );
};
```

This can be especially useful when you need to swap between `a` and `button` or `h1`, `h2`, `h3`. You don't need to create multiple styled components for that.

## `$ref` prop

What are [React refs](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html)?

> In the typical React dataflow, props are the only way that parent components interact with their children. To modify a child, you re-render it with new props. However, there are a few cases where you need to imperatively modify a child outside of the typical dataflow. The child to be modified could be an instance of a React component, or it could be a DOM element. For both of these cases, React provides an escape hatch.

**Refs is an escape hatch so you can directly modify the instance of a React component**. For example, we have an input and button and we want to focus the input when the button is clicked:

```jsx live
class MyApp extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    this.inputRef = React.createRef();
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <input ref={this.inputRef} />
        <button onClick={() => this.inputRef.current.focus()}>
          Focus input
        </button>
      </>
    );
  }
}
```

However, if `input` is not just a simple input but styled component `<Input />` this will not work:

```jsx
import { styled } from "styletron-react";

const Input = styled("input", { background: "#FFE1A5" });

// …
<Input ref={this.inputRef} />;
// …
```

React will complain:

> Warning: Function components cannot be given refs. Attempts to access this ref will fail. Did you mean to use React.forwardRef()?

**`styled` creates a function component** and not class based component. **Function components can't accept a ref**.

React gives a great suggestion to library maintainers to forward refs with [React.forwardRef](https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html) API. This is a fairly new feature (React v16.3). Styletron [will most likely adopt it](https://github.com/styletron/styletron/issues/253) in the next major version. In meantime, Styletron provides an alternative ref forwarding scheme through the `$ref` prop:

```jsx live
import { styled } from "styletron-react";

class MyApp extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    this.inputRef = React.createRef();
  }
  render() {
    const Input = styled("input", { background: "#FFE1A5" });
    return (
      <>
        <Input $ref={this.inputRef} />
        <button onClick={() => this.inputRef.current.focus()}>
          Focus input
        </button>
      </>
    );
  }
}
```

**Just rename `ref` to `$ref`**. That's it!

## Composing Styles

Styled components are quite locked down. They come with defined styles and underlying DOM element. You can swap the DOM element with the [`$as` prop](#as-prop) but **what if you want to tweak some styles** as well?

`styletron-react` exports several composition functions. These can be used to create new styled components by composing styles from existing ones. You don't need to create a new component from scratch. Perfect for tweaks!

### withStyle

Do you need to slightly modify an existing styled component like changing the color?

```jsx live
import { withStyle, styled } from "styletron-react";

export default () => {
  const RedButton = styled("button", {
    color: "red",
    border: "2px solid black",
    display: "block",
    margin: "1em 0"
  });
  const BlueButton = withStyle(RedButton, { color: "blue" });
  return (
    <>
      <RedButton>Red Button</RedButton>
      <BlueButton>Blue Button</BlueButton>
    </>
  );
};
```

**`BlueButton` overrides the `color` property** but keeps other `RedButton`'s styles intact. This is especially useful if you don't own the `RedButton` component and you can't change its API (adding `$isBlue` prop?).

### withStyleDeep

The style object can be nested when pseudo classes (`:hover`, `:focus`, etc.) are used. The problem is that `withStyle` blindly overrides only the first level:

```jsx live
import { withStyle, styled } from "styletron-react";

export default () => {
  const HoverRed = styled("button", {
    ":hover": {
      color: "red",
      border: "2px dashed black"
    },
    border: "2px solid black",
    display: "block",
    margin: "1em 0"
  });
  const HoverBlue = withStyle(HoverRed, {
    ":hover": {
      color: "blue"
    }
  });
  return (
    <>
      <HoverRed>Hover Red Button</HoverRed>
      <HoverBlue>Hover Blue Button</HoverBlue>
    </>
  );
};
```

`HoverBlue` gets blue when hovered but it doesn't have the dashed border. That's because `withStyle` replaced the whole `:hover` property and _didn't look inside_. To fix that, you can use `withStyleDeep` instead:

```jsx live
import { withStyleDeep, styled } from "styletron-react";

export default () => {
  const HoverRed = styled("button", {
    ":hover": {
      color: "red",
      border: "2px dashed black"
    },
    border: "2px solid black",
    display: "block",
    margin: "1em 0"
  });
  const HoverBlue = withStyleDeep(HoverRed, {
    ":hover": {
      color: "blue"
    }
  });
  return (
    <>
      <HoverRed>Hover Red Button</HoverRed>
      <HoverBlue>Hover Blue Button</HoverBlue>
    </>
  );
};
```

`:hover` object is now deeply merged and `HoverBlue` preserves the dashed border style.

#### Note

`withStyle` and `withStyleDeep` are powerful functions but you should avoid over-using them. Often times, it's better to update the original component and add some addition props to it. For example, instead of

```jsx
const PrimaryButton = withStyle(Button, { color: "blue" });
const SecondaryButton = withStyle(Button, { color: "green" });
const TertiaryButton = withStyle(Button, { color: "yellow" });
```

it might be better to add `type` property to the `Button` component

```jsx
const getButtonColor = type => {
  switch(type) {
    case "primary":
      return "blue";
    case "secondary":
      return "green";
    case "tertiary":
      return "yellow";
    default:
      return "black";
  }
}

const Button = styled('button', props => ({
  color: getButtonColor(props.type)
}))

<Button type="primary" />
<Button type="secondary" />
<Button type="tertiary" />
```

It's more verbose but you will end up with a single component `Button` that doesn't rely on internal styles. In the future, you can decide to replace `color` by `backgroundColor` and it will not break "withStyled" components.

## displayName

> The displayName string is used in debugging messages. Usually, you don’t need to set it explicitly because it’s inferred from the name of the function or class that defines the component. You might want to set it explicitly if you want to display a different name for debugging purposes or when you create a higher-order component, see Wrap the Display Name for Easy Debugging for details.

Since **`styled` is technically a higher-order component**, we need to set the `displayName` explicitly to see the real component names when debugging (or snapshot testing). If you are tired of doing this manually, we provide `babel-plugin-transform-styletron-display-name` that will do this for you!

```bash
yarn add babel-plugin-transform-styletron-display-name
```

Add this plugin into your `.babelrc`:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["babel-plugin-transform-styletron-display-name"]
}
```

The plugin takes this code

```js
const Foo = styled("div", {
  color: "red"
});
```

and transforms it into

```js
Foo = styled("div", {
  color: "red"
});
Foo.displayName = "Foo";
```

## Themes

You probably want to keep colors or sizing consistent across various components. A good practice is to keep these values defined in a single location so you can change them globally. You could create a module for this purpose:

```js
// theme.js
const THEME = {
  colors: {
    primary: ["#276EF1", "#174EB6", "#9CBCF8"],
    positive: ["#07A35A", "#057C44", "#88D3B0"]
  },
  sizing: ["2px", "6px", "10px", "16px", "24px"]
};
export default THEME;
```

and then import it in your components

```jsx
import { styled } from "styletron-react";
import THEME from "./theme";

export default () => {
  const Card = styled("div", {
    padding: THEME.sizing[3],
    backgroundColor: THEME.colors.positive[0]
  });
};
```

This works but **there are some downsides**:

- You have to always import the theme module
- You can't easily dynamically switch between multiple themes (imagine having some dark mode toggle in your app)

We can solve both issues by using [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) instead and creating our own enhanced `styled` function that will always hand over the theme to the styled function through the props argument:

```jsx live
import { createStyled } from "styletron-react";
import { driver, getInitialStyle } from "styletron-standard";

// code bellow would be normally module (top-level) scoped
// to keep this example editable, it's wrapped by a React
// function component
export default () => {
  const THEME = {
    colors: {
      primary: ["#276EF1", "#174EB6", "#9CBCF8"],
      positive: ["#07A35A", "#057C44", "#88D3B0"]
    },
    sizing: ["2px", "6px", "10px", "16px", "24px"]
  };

  const { Provider, Consumer } = React.createContext();

  const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => (
    <Provider value={THEME}>{children}</Provider>
  );

  const wrapper = StyledComponent =>
    function withThemeHOC(props) {
      return (
        <Consumer>
          {theme => <StyledComponent {...props} $theme={theme} />}
        </Consumer>
      );
    };

  const styled = createStyled({ wrapper, getInitialStyle, driver });

  const Button = styled("button", ({ $theme }) => ({
    backgroundColor: $theme.colors.primary[0],
    color: "#FFF",
    fontSize: $theme.sizing[3],
    padding: $theme.sizing[1]
  }));

  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <Button>Button</Button>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```

[createStyled](/api#createstyled) is a utility function provided by `styletron-react` so you can create your own styled function.

We are accessing the `THEME` through React Context and passing it as the `$theme` prop so every `StyledComponent` (aka component using our new `styled` function) can use it.

Finally, we need to wrap the root of our application with `ThemeProvider` so the `THEME` constant is passed to the whole React tree. If we wanted to enable switching between multiple themes, we could place the related logic into `ThemeProvider` component.

## Testing

You can test styled components as any other React component. Just don't forget to wrap the tested component with `StyletronProvider`!

One popular approach is [snapshot testing](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing). You can emit (render) the HTML markup, save it into a file and diff it on the next run. This will prevent unwanted changes in the component's output.

**With Styletron, you can take this approach one step further**. Your styles live in JavaScript too, so you can add them to your snapshots and capture both HTML and CSS output. This will require some setup.
