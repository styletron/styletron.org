# Concepts

CSS in JS is not just about _throwing_ some CSS into `.js` files. **CSS in JS comes with a different philosophy**. You can still use the most of CSS constructs but there are some quirks and limitations when a different approach is required. Those restrictions are not necessarily bad but it can be certainly frustrating if you are not aware of them. This page aims to answer most of the "_How to do x in Styletron_" questions and suggest some good practices.

Most of the concepts described bellow are not React specific but we still use React and `styletron-react` to demonstrate them.

1. [Style Object](#style-object)
2. [Style Function](#style-function)
3. [Media Queries And Pseudo Classes](#media-queries-and-pseudo-classes)
4. [Selectors](#selectors)
5. [Fonts](#fonts)
6. [Keyframes](#keyframes)
7. [Vendor Prefixes](#vendor-prefixes)
8. [Pitfalls](#pitfalls)

## Style Object

CSS properties are defined as a JS object and that has some limitations compared to the pure CSS:

```css
.btn {
  color: red;
  font-size: 16px;
  padding-left: 1em;
  padding-right: 1em;
}
```

translates into

```jsx live
import { styled } from "styletron-react";

export default () => {
  const Button = styled("button", {
    color: "red",
    fontSize: "16px",
    paddingLeft: "1em",
    paddingRight: "1em"
  });
  return <Button>Button</Button>;
};
```

We use `camelCase` for property names since JS can't handle `-` in the object key. Although, you could add quotes to work around it:

```js
{
  "font-size": "16px",
  "padding-left": "1em",
  "padding-right": "1em"
}
```

This code still works but we usually try to avoid quoting object keys in JavaScript.

## Style Function

```text
props => CSS styles
```

Component styles often change based on `props`. We call it **dynamic styling**. `styled`'s second argument can accept a function that gets `props` and returns a style object:

```jsx live
import { styled } from "styletron-react";

export default () => {
  const Button = styled("button", props => ({
    fontSize: props.$compact ? "12px" : "16px",
    padding: props.$compact ? "0.25em" : "0.5em",
    margin: "0.5em"
  }));
  return (
    <>
      <Button>Standard Button</Button>
      <Button $compact>Compact Button</Button>
    </>
  );
};
```

If you wonder why we called our prop `$compact` and not just `compact`, see [the explanation](/react#as-prop).

## Media Queries And Pseudo Classes

The style object can be nested so you can define media queries and most of pseudo classes:

```jsx live
import { styled } from "styletron-react";

export default () => {
  const Block = styled("div", {
    backgroundColor: "#DDD",
    color: "#000",
    padding: "0.5em 1em",
    border: "2px solid black",
    ":hover": {
      border: "2px dashed darkred"
    },
    "@media screen and (max-width: 880px)": {
      backgroundColor: "#276EF1",
      color: "#fff"
    }
  });
  return <Block>I get blue when the browser window shrinks</Block>;
};
```

It might be a good idea to use the same breakpoints across multiple components. You can just abstract them into a constant:

```jsx
const MOBILE = "@media screen and (max-width: 880px)";
const styles = {
  [MOBILE]: {
    backgroundColor: "#276EF1",
    color: "#fff"
  }
};
```

## Selectors

One of the premises of CSS in JS is keeping all styles local, isolated and avoiding any [specificity shenanigans](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity). It is probably the most controversial thing about CSS in JS since it requires a significant mind shift and using other patterns.

**Styletron doesn't support [simple selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors#Simple_selectors) and [combinators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors#Combinators). You can still use [pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) and [pseudo-elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements).**

CSS is a powerful language and **many complex selectors and combinators just don't fit into CSS in JS model well**. There are definitely valid cases when things like descedant combinators can be used and we have been exploring a [possible API](https://github.com/styletron/styletron/issues/229) for that.

For now, there are some workarounds for common cases that we recommend to use. However, if you are trying to implement something like this:

```css
div:nth-of-type(2) ul:last-child li:nth-of-type(even) * {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

Then you're probably doing it wrong and should move your styles closer to the styled elements.

### Child Combinator

**CSS syntax: `A > B`**

> Any element matching B that is a _direct_ child of an element matching A.

For this use-case, you can use [React.Children.map](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactchildren) and [React.cloneElement](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#cloneelement) to pass additional children props. A very useful prop might be the child `index` so you can simulate [:nth-child](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child) CSS pseudo class:

```jsx live
export default () => {
  // createContext should be module scoped
  // and imported by Parent and Child
  const ParentContext = React.createContext();

  const ButtonGroup = ({ children }) => {
    return React.Children.map(children, (child, index) =>
      React.cloneElement(child, { groupIndex: index })
    );
  };

  const Button = ({ groupIndex, children }) => {
    const Btn = styled("button", props => ({
      margin: props.$isGrouped ? "0px" : "0 2em 0 0"
    }));
    return (
      <Btn $isGrouped={typeof groupIndex !== "undefined"}>
        {children} {groupIndex}
      </Btn>
    );
  };

  return (
    <>
      <p>
        <ButtonGroup>
          <Button>One</Button>
          <Button>Two</Button>
          <Button>Three</Button>
        </ButtonGroup>
      </p>
      <p>
        <Button>One</Button>
        <Button>Two</Button>
        <Button>Three</Button>
      </p>
    </>
  );
};
```

**This works only if `Button` is a direct child of `ButtonGroup`**. One downside of this solution is prop name pollution. The prop `groupIndex` is hard-coded in `ButtonGroup` and `Button` component can't use it for other purposes. However, it's usually not a big problem in real applications. Widely used higher-order components do the exactly same thing.

On the other hand, you can now test all the visual `Button` states even without `ButtonGroup`. You can set the `groupIndex` explicitly

```jsx
<Button groupIndex={0}>One</Button>
<Button groupIndex={1}>Two</Button>
<Button groupIndex={2}>Three</Button>
```

to simulate the `ButtonGroup`'s functionality.

### Descendant Combinator

**CSS syntax: `A B`**

> Any element matching B that is a _descendant_ of an element matching A (that is, a child, or a child of a child, etc.). the combinator is one or more spaces or dual greater than signs.

If you want to control styles of descendant components, you can use [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) and the [context hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext).

```jsx live
export default () => {
  // createContext should be module scoped
  // and imported by Parent and Child
  const ParentContext = React.createContext();

  const Parent = ({ children }) => {
    const { Provider } = ParentContext;
    return <Provider value="blue">{children}</Provider>;
  };

  const Child = () => {
    const Text = styled("div", props => ({
      color: props.$color
    }));
    const value = React.useContext(ParentContext) || "black";
    return <Text $color={value}>This text is {value}.</Text>;
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Parent>
        <div>
          <Child />
        </div>
      </Parent>
      <Child />
    </>
  );
};
```

`Child` is not a direct descendant of `Parent` and yet, it still gets the value `blue`. We are crossing component boundaries without passing additional `props` or using a CSS combinator.

### Descendant Hover

React hook [useHover](https://usehooks.com/useHover/) provides a nice concise API to have full control over hover states:

```jsx live
export default () => {
  const [hoverRef, hovered] = useHover();
  const Parent = styled("div", {
    backgroundColor: "#DDD",
    textAlign: "center",
    padding: "0.5em"
  });
  const Child = styled("span", props => ({
    fontSize: "2em",
    borderBottomWidth: "2px",
    borderBottomStyle: "solid",
    borderBottomColor: props.$hovered ? "darkred" : "#DDD"
  }));
  return (
    <Parent $ref={hoverRef}>
      <Child $hovered={hovered}>{hovered ? "😁" : "☹️"}</Child>
    </Parent>
  );
};
```

**This solution avoids using CSS altogether** and lets you pass `hovered` anywhere you want.

Since JS is used instead, it's less efficient but preserves the component encapsulation.

## Fonts

Do you need to use `@font-face`? Styletron provides a declarative way to do it. You can turn

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Laila";
  src: url("./static/Laila.ttf");
}

.font-laila {
  font-family: "Laila", serif;
}
```

into

```jsx live
import { styled } from "styletron-react";

export default () => {
  const FontLaila = styled("div", {
    fontFamily: {
      src: "url(./static/Laila.ttf)"
    }
  });
  return <FontLaila>This is Laila font.</FontLaila>;
};
```

## Keyframes

CSS offers a powerful animation API `@keyframes`. Styletron provides a declarative way to use it. You can turn

```css
@keyframes move {
  from {
    margin-left: 80%;
    width: 300%;
  }

  to {
    margin-left: 0%;
    width: 100%;
  }
}

.slide-in {
  animation-duration: 3s;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  animation-name: move;
}
```

into

```jsx live
import { styled } from "styletron-react";

export default () => {
  const SlideIn = styled("div", {
    animationDuration: "3s",
    animationIterationCount: "infinite",
    animationName: {
      from: {
        marginLeft: "80%",
        width: "300%"
      },
      to: {
        marginLeft: "0%",
        width: "100%"
      }
    }
  });
  return <SlideIn>This is animated.</SlideIn>;
};
```

## Vendor Prefixes

What are [vendor prefixes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Vendor_Prefix)?

> Browser vendors sometimes add prefixes to experimental or nonstandard CSS properties and JavaScript APIs, so developers can experiment with new ideas while—in theory—preventing their experiments from being relied upon and then breaking web developers' code during the standardization process.

**Some of these experimental or nonstandard CSS properties are extremely useful** and developers don't want to wait for their full standardization. Thus, they need to add correct vendor prefixes. Styletron uses [inline-style-prefixer](https://github.com/rofrischmann/inline-style-prefixer) to do this for you! It dynamically detects your browser version and adds vendor prefixes when needed.

This is also pretty common technique used by CSS post/pre-processors. It's known as [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).

Adding vendor prefixes manually is **verbose and error prone**:

```css
.boring {
  -webkit-transition: 200ms all linear;
  transition: 200ms all linear;
  -webkit-user-select: none;
  -moz-user-select: none;
  -ms-user-select: none;
  user-select: none;
  -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  display: -webkit-box;
  display: -ms-flexbox;
  display: flex;
}
```

Styletron and `inline-style-prefixer` takes care of it:

```jsx live
import { styled } from "styletron-react";

export default () => {
  const Prefixed = styled("div", {
    transition: "200ms all linear",
    userSelect: "none",
    boxSizing: "border-box",
    display: "flex"
  });
  return (
    <Prefixed>
      Inspect this element in different browsers. Hey Safari. 😅
    </Prefixed>
  );
};
```

## Pitfalls

### Shorthand And Longhand Properties

Many CSS properties can be defined through the shorthand syntax. For example

```css
border-width: 2px;
border-style: solid;
border-color: black;
```

can be replaced by

```css
border: 2px solid black;
```

You can use both shorthand and longhand properties in Styletron; however, **you should never mix them in a single styled component**!

This is perfectly fine in classic CSS

```css
.content {
  border: 2px solid black;
  border-width: 5px;
}
```

since the order is always respected and `border-width` will be set to `5px`. But if you do the same thing in Styletron

```css
const Content = styled('div', {
  border: '2px solid black',
  borderWidth: '5px'
});
```

it's not clear if the `border-width` will be `5px` or `2px`. Why?

> JavaScript object is an **unordered collection of properties** each of which contains a primitive value, object, or function.

The order is not deterministic. Also, Styletron splits each rule into a separate CSS class (Atomic CSS) and reuses same classes across multiple styled components. **So if some other component already uses the `borderWidth: '5px'`** rule and is mounted before the `Content` component, there is a great chance that **you will end up with `2px`** since the order of in which CSS classes are defined matters and Styletron adds them incrementally as components are being mounted.

For the same reason, you should avoid overlapping media queries as well.

### Quotes

```jsx live
import { styled } from "styletron-react";

export default () => {
  const Button = styled("button", {
    color: "white",
    backgroundColor: "white",
    "::before": {
      content: '"…"',
      color: "black",
      display: "block",
      position: "absolute"
    }
  });
  return <Button>xx</Button>;
};
```

**This snippet works as expected**. The lesson here is to not forget about double quotes when using properties as `content` since browsers expect that the resulting value will be surrounded by `" "` and the first pair of quotes is there just because of JavaScript.

**This doesn't not work:**

```text
content: '…',
```
