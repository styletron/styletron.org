**Styletron is an universal toolkit for component-oriented styling**. It falls into the [CSS in JS](https://github.com/tuchk4/awesome-css-in-js) category. Styletron works great with [React](https://reactjs.org/) but can be used with other frameworks or plain JS as well.

[Looking for v3 docs](https://www.styletron.org/v3/) or [v3 to v4 migration guide](https://github.com/styletron/styletron/blob/master/docs/v3-migration-guide.md)?

## Example

```jsx live
import { styled } from "styletron-react";

export default () => {
  // Create a styled component by passing
  // an element name and a style object
  const Anchor = styled("a", {
    fontSize: "20px",
    color: "red",
  });
  return <Anchor href="/getting-started">Start!</Anchor>;
};
```

Styletron provides [styletron-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styletron-react) with some handy React utilities. In the example above, we use the `styled` function to create a styled React component.

**What is happening behind the scene?**

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      .foo {
        font-size: 20px;
      }
      .bar {
        color: red;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a href="/getting-started" class="foo bar">Start!</a>
  </body>
</html>
```

Styletron processes the style object and creates two atomic classes. **The class names are auto-generated**. So you don't have to worry about [naming methodologies](http://getbem.com/introduction/)! **That's great!** What's less great? The generated names are not stable and will change all the time so you should never target them. If you need a stable selector for something as e2e tests, you should add `data-test-id` attribute.

Since Styletron uses the `<style />` tag, you can use **media queries** and other selectors as well. You could not do that with inline styles! Check [Concepts](/concepts) for more information about how classic CSS translates into CSS in JS.

Finally, the `Anchor` component is created and its `className` prop is set to `".foo .bar"`.

## Features

### Performance

**Styletron generates styles only when absolutely needed**. This concept is also known as [critical rendering path](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/). This means that your browser never needs to process CSS rules that are not being used. Styletron does declaration-level de-duplication known as [Atomic CSS](https://acss.io/). **It dramatically reduces the redundancy of CSS rules**. Also, Styletron is pretty compact and will add less than 8kB (gzip) to your bundle.

### No extra tooling required

If you want to make sure that your CSS scales well with the size of application, you might need to reach for some additional tooling. For example, a comparable approach called [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) requires you to use Webpack and its [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader). To improve the developer experience even further, many projects also rely on post/pre-processing with [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) or [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/).

On the other hand, using Styletron means adding just an additional npm module into your project. **It doesn't require a specific compiler or bundler setup**.

### Portability

Your styles are written in JavaScript and co-located with your components. **It is the same developer experience as using inline styles but without any drawbacks**. You can use standard modularization and code-splitting techniques. As long as your application has Styletron installed, everything works!

There are many other benefits that CSS in JS brings. For more context, you can check the [React: CSS in JS](https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js) presentation.
