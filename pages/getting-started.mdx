import Layout from "../components/layout";

export default Layout;

# Getting Started

Styletron is distributed through [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/). It consists of a few packages. **The basic React setup requires adding two of them**:

```bash
yarn add styletron-engine-atomic styletron-react
```

## Packages

### [styletron-engine-atomic](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styletron-engine-atomic)

This package is all you need to start with Styletron. It is an implementation of the [styletron-standard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styletron-standard) engine interface.

### [styletron-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styletron-react)

This package provides additional React bindings so you can easily create styled React components.

### [styletron-engine-monolithic](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styletron-engine-monolithic)

This package is an alternative implementation of the [styletron-standard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styletron-standard) engine interface. The monolithic engine is a superset of the atomic engine - everything that works in the atomic engine will keep working with the monolithic engine. In comparison with the atomic engine:

- class names are stable (hashes) in the monolithic engine, so components can be cross-referenced,
- using the monolithic engine, you can mix longhand and shorthand properties,
- media queries are not sorted, since the order is always respected,
- it supports [@supports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports).

These improvements are made possible by sacrificing the minimal CSS footprint the atomic engine strives for.

### Types

Styletron is [Flow typed](https://flow.org/) by default. Do you use TypeScript?

```bash
yarn add @types/styletron-standard
yarn add @types/styletron-react
yarn add @types/styletron-engine-atomic

# we do not have typescript definitions for the monolithic engine yet
# are you interested in adding them?
# let us know at https://github.com/styletron/styletron/issues
```

## Starting with

1. [React](#with-react)
2. [Fusion.js](#with-fusionjs)
3. [Next.js](#with-nextjs)
4. [Gatsby](#with-gatsby)
5. [Vanilla JS](#with-javascript)

## With React

> If you are using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), this is the section that applies to your application.

**You need to wrap your application root with the `StyletronProvider`** and pass an instance of Styletron into it. [React context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) is used in the background to ensure that CSS rules are properly extracted and CSS classes created.

```jsx
import { Provider as StyletronProvider, DebugEngine } from "styletron-react";
import { Client as Styletron } from "styletron-engine-atomic";

const debug =
  process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? void 0 : new DebugEngine();

// 1. Create a client engine instance
const engine = new Styletron();

// 2. Provide the engine to the app
// debug engine needs inlined source maps
React.render(
  <StyletronProvider value={engine} debug={debug} debugAfterHydration>
    <App />
  </StyletronProvider>
);
```

### Server-side Rendering

Styletron also supports **server-side rendering** so you can generate the styles on the server and then "hydrate" the client. This can significantly improve the loading time of your application!

#### Extracting Server-rendered Styles

```jsx
import { Provider as StyletronProvider } from "styletron-react";
import { Server as Styletron } from "styletron-engine-atomic";

// 1. Create a server engine instance
const engine = new Styletron();

// 2. Provide the engine to the app
const html = React.render(
  <StyletronProvider value={engine}>
    <App />
  </StyletronProvider>
);

// 3. Extract critical styles after SSR
const styles = engine.getStylesheetsHtml();
// â†’ "<style ..."
```

#### Hydrating Server-rendered Styles

```diff
import {Provider as StyletronProvider} from "styletron-react";
import {Client as Styletron} from "styletron-engine-atomic";

- const engine = new Styletron();
+ const engine = new Styletron({
+  hydrate: document.getElementsByClassName("_styletron_hydrate_")
+ });

React.render(
  <StyletronProvider value={engine}>
    <App/>
  </StyletronProvider>
);
```

#### Using the monolithic engine

The setup is the same as with the atomic engine - the only difference is that we have to replace `styletron-engine-atomic` with `styletron-engine-monolithic`.

##### Add `styletron-engine-monolithic` as a dependency

```bash
yarn add styletron-engine-monolithic styletron-react
```

##### Add `styletron-engine-monolithic` to your project

```js
import { Provider as StyletronProvider, DebugEngine } from "styletron-react";
import { Client as Styletron } from "styletron-engine-monolithic";

const debug =
  process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? void 0 : new DebugEngine();

// 1. Create a client engine instance
const engine = new Styletron();

// 2. Provide the engine to the app
// debug engine needs inlined source maps
React.render(
  <StyletronProvider value={engine} debug={debug} debugAfterHydration>
    <App />
  </StyletronProvider>
);
```

## With Fusion.js

[Fusion.js](https://fusionjs.com/) is a plugin-based universal web framework. Your application might already support Styletron out of the box! Check if [fusion-plugin-styletron-react](https://github.com/fusionjs/fusion-plugin-styletron-react) has been installed. If not, run

```bash
yarn add fusion-plugin-styletron-react styletron-react
```

Register the plugin in `src/main.js`:

```js
import App from "fusion-react";
import Styletron from "fusion-plugin-styletron-react";
import root from "./components/root";

export default () => {
  const app = new App(root);
  app.register(Styletron);
  return app;
};
```

Then you can directly import and use `styled` function. `src/root.js`:

```jsx
import { styled } from "fusion-plugin-styletron-react";

const Colored = styled("div", { color: "blue" });

function Home() {
  return <Colored>Welcome to Fusion.js!</Colored>;
}

export default Home;
```

## With Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a popular React framework. There is an example [Next.js + Styletron app](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-styletron). You can bootstrap a new project by:

```bash
yarn create next-app --example with-styletron with-styletron-app
```

Run the app:

```
yarn
yarn dev
```

## With Gatsby

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) is a fast modern site generator for React. There is a [gatsby-plugin-styletron](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-styletron/). First, add it to your Gatsby app:

```bash
yarn add gatsby-plugin-styletron
```

and edit `gatsby-config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "gatsby-plugin-styletron",
      options: {
        // You can pass options to Styletron.
        // Prefix all generated classNames:
        prefix: "_",
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

That's it! Now you should be able to style your components and the styles should be server-side rendered (in production build). `src/pages/index.js`:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useStyletron } from "styletron-react";

function Home() {
  const [css] = useStyletron();
  return (
    <div
      className={css({
        color: "blue",
      })}
    >
      Welcome to Gatsby!
    </div>
  );
}

export default Home;
```

## With JavaScript

**Do you use some other framework? Or no framework at all?** You can directly use `styletron-engine-atomic` to render styles. Check the [API documentation](/api-reference).
